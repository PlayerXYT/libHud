libHud is an all-in-one Minecraft mod to modify the rendering of the game from any loader. It is a library mod meaning it does nothing by itself but may be a dependency for other mods.

Features: (crossed out=coming soon)
- HUD changing (what players see in game, hotbar, health, etc)
- ~~Menu changing (custom options in the pause menu)~~
- ~~Mod configs (for forge built-in or [modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for fabric)~~
- ~~Player rendering~~
- ~~Mob rendering~~
- ~~Block rendering~~
